Python Invented by "Guido van Russum".

Software :
 >> S/w is a set of instructions to hardware.

Programming :
 >>Writing the instructions to create a s/w.

Code:
>> The instructions that we write to create a s/w.

syntax:
 >> Rules of language.
1. Why python?
>> Python is easy to learn .


>> It is a powerful programming language.


>> It is possible to create the programs with minimal amount of code.


>> Python is versatile language which has many applications in almost every field.

VARIABLES AND DATA TYPES:
>>variables are like containers for storing the values.

>>values in the variables can be changed.

value:
>>In the context of programming the info is often referred to as value

Data types:
 >>In programming language every value or data has an associated type it is known as data type.
 
 >>int,float,string,boolean.
 
 >>data type determines how the value or data can be used in the program.

String:

>>string is a stream of characters enclosed within the quotes. stream of characters consists of capital letters,small letters,space,special characters,digits.

Ex:"Hello World","1234"

Float: 24.3,345.10

Integers:-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3.

Boolean: Yes or No,True or False,0 or 1,On or Off.

Assigning values to the variables:

>>       variable name<-age=10->variable value and here = is Assignment operator.

Sequence of Instructions:

>>python executes the code line by line(Interpreted language).

Common mistakes:

1)Printing values in variables
